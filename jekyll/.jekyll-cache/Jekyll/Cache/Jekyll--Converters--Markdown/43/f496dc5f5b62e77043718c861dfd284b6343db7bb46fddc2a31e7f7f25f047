<h2 id="elements-of-performance">Elements of Performance</h2>

<p>The perception of performance is largely determined by four factors: <em>Duration</em>, <em>Responsiveness</em>, <em>Fluency</em> and <em>Tolerance</em>.</p>

<h3 id="duration">Duration</h3>

<p>Duration is the actual duration that a process takes. This is the element that is often referred to as “performance” in technical discussions. Different magnitudes of duration require different treatments to achieve an optimal perceived performance.</p>

<table>
  <thead style="vertical-align: top;">
    <tr>
      <th>Terminology</th>
      <th>Duration</th>
      <th>Response</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody style="vertical-align: top;">
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Instantaneous</strong></td>
      <td>up to 100ms</td>
      <td>Acknowledge user input within this time frame. Ideally, a visible process towards the completion of the task begins within this time span.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Immediate</strong></td>
      <td>500–1000ms</td>
      <td>Answers to simple requests must be completed within this time frame (e.g., opening a new window).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Continuous</strong></td>
      <td>2000–5000ms</td>
      <td>Answers to complex questions must be completed within this time frame (e.g., loading a web page).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Captive</strong></td>
      <td>7000–10000ms</td>
      <td>Users will begin switching tasks at this point. If a process takes longer than this, it should be segmented.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h3 id="responsiveness">Responsiveness</h3>

<p>Responsiveness is the perceived time it takes the system to respond to user input.</p>

<p>Example: An empty dialog appearing immediately after a click and then taking a second to populate with content feels faster than the same dialog appearing with a second delay, but fully populated.</p>

    <div class="do">
      <p><img src="../images/global/check.svg" alt="Checkmark icon indicating a good choice" /> Do</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<div>
    <iframe src="/photon/interactives/introduction/performance-principles/responsiveness/example-dont.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <div class="dont">
      <p><img src="../images/global/stop.svg" alt="Cross icon indicating a bad choice" /> Don’t</p>
    </div>

  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="fluency">Fluency</h3>

<p>Fluency is the perceived smoothness of a process. It could also be described as a measure for how hard the machine appears to be working. Aim for constant 60 frames per second.</p>

<p>Example: A stuttering progress indicator gives the impression of lower performance, regardless of the actual duration of the process.</p>

<div class="grid-3">
<div>
    <iframe src="/photon/interactives/introduction/performance-principles/fluency/example-do.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <div class="dont">
      <p><img src="../images/global/stop.svg" alt="Cross icon indicating a bad choice" /> Don’t</p>
    </div>

  </div>

      <p><img src="../images/global/check.svg" alt="Checkmark icon indicating a good choice" /> Do</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="tolerance">Tolerance</h3>

<p>Tolerance is a measure of how long the user expects a process to take and at what point they will abandon or cancel the process.</p>

<p>Example: The tolerated duration for loading a web page is much longer than for saving a bookmark.</p>

<div class="grid-2">
<div>
    <iframe src="/photon/interactives/introduction/performance-principles/tolerance/example-do.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <div class="do">
      <p><img src="../images/global/check.svg" alt="Checkmark icon indicating a good choice" /> Do</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<div>
    <iframe src="/photon/interactives/introduction/performance-principles/tolerance/example-dont.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <div class="dont">
      <p><img src="../images/global/stop.svg" alt="Cross icon indicating a bad choice" /> Don’t</p>
    </div>

  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="bias-and-priming">Bias and Priming</h3>

<p>A user’s preconception about the speed of something – based on brand or prior knowledge – influences the perception of time.</p>

<p>Example: Users perceived a browser as being faster after reading an article about that browser having improved performance recently.</p>

<h2 id="other-influencing-factors">Other Influencing Factors</h2>

<p>These factors can also influence the perception of performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Perceived task complexity</li>
  <li>Emotional state</li>
  <li>UI complexity and visual noise</li>
  <li>Trends</li>
  <li>Task frequency, attempts, failures</li>
</ul>
