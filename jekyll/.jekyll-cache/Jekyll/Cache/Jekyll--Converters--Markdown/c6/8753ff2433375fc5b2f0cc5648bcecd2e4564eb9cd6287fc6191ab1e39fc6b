I"š<p>Designing, developing and writing for Firefox requires considering the diversity and experiences of multiple populations (our products are localized for 80 languages and dialects) who increasingly rely on the internet to conduct their daily lives.</p>

<p>The Mozilla Manifesto puts it this way: <em>The Internet is an integral part of modern lifeâ€”a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.</em></p>

<p>Meeting the needs of millions of users introduces dozens of challenges. A 10-word sentence may require 20 words to translate effectively. Or, worse, the sentence may not be appropriate for a regionâ€™s sensibilities. The localization <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:WorldReady">team wiki</a> offers advice on the specifics of writing for localization. And these <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_content_best_practices">localization best practices</a> help developers create more localizable code.</p>

<p>Firefox also strives for accessibility, the idea that software should be usable and, to the extent possible, convenient for people with disabilities. The Mozilla Developer Network maintains a robust guide to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Accessibility">accessibility</a> covering everything from the accessibility basics to HTML, CSS and JavaScript best practices.</p>
