I"¤<p>Firefox 57 marks the launch of a new product identity system that reflects the Photon design vision.  The first elements available in this system are the app icons for Firefox browsers and other Firefox-branded products.  These retain familiar elements of past app icons (like the fox and globe) but signal the profound changes in the product with bold colors and simplified shapes from the Photon Design System.</p>
