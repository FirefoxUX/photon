I"ð<p>The primary job of the words in Firefox is helping users complete tasks and accomplish tasks, with no confusion and minimal interruption. But the words also offer a glimpse into Firefoxâ€™s personality. The voice and tone we use influence how people think and feel about Firefox. The words we choose â€” and the ways we use them â€” sound human because they reflect human goals: building trust, inspiring confidence, making things easier, and developing a relationship with Firefox users.</p>
