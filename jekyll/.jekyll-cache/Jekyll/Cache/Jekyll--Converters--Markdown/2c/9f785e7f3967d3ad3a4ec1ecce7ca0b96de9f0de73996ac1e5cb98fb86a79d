<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Illustrations are a visually and emotionally powerful tool. So use them sparingly and carefully identify the right situations for them. If an illustration is used only as a decorative element, it may lose its communicative power and distract people.</p>

<p>Use illustration to encourage users who are frustrated, are lost, or have had something go wrong. Donâ€™t use illustration if the user is in danger.</p>
