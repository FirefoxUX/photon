When all of your measurements follow the same rules, you automatically get a more consistent UI.

## Baseline Grid

<div class="grid-2" markdown="1">
The grid is based on a 4px square. This value controls the proportion, balance, and vertical alignment of every component. All elements &ndash; including icons &ndash; are aligned to this unit.

> For Android, use the very similar [Material Baseline Grid](https://material.io/guidelines/layout/metrics-keylines.html#metrics-keylines-baseline-grids).

</div>

## Spacing

When you design a component, elements are spaced following the grid. The same principle applies when you stack multiple elements within and between a component.
