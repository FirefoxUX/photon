#### Color Contrast Values

* **Fail** – Your text doesn't have enough contrast with the background.

### Color Blind

There are different types of color blindness. The most common form is red-green color blindness, followed by blue-yellow color blindness and total color blindness. Red-green color blindness affects up to 8% of males and 0.5% of females. Ensure that adjacent color shades are distinguishable for color blind people. Use a color blindness analyzer to confirm your choices.

### High Contrast on Windows

Windows currently offers multiple high contrast modes. Ensure that colors are translated properly, following the hierarchy defined for the default theme.
