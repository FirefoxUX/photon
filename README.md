Once you have something you like, it's time to share it with the rest of us!

To get your changes merged:
* Make sure you're working on `master`, and submit the pull request to there.
* Make your pull request as small as possible (so it's easier to review and merge them).
* If it's something that needs to be merged as soon as possible, add a tag (e.g. urgent).
