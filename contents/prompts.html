<h2>Prompts</h2>

<h3>Authentication Prompts</h3>
<p>Use authentication prompts when websites require that users sign in to access any content from the server.</p>

<h3>Modal Prompts</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Tab modal, where the prompt appears anchored beneath the awesome bar. </li>
<li>Application modal, where the prompt appears over the awesome bar, anchored to the top chrome. </li> 
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Notification Bars</h3>

<p>Use notification bars to inform users of informational, urgent, or emergency states in the browser that don’t require user interaction. Assume anything in these bars could be missed or dismissed without reading.
