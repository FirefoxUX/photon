  <h1>Grid</h1>
  <p>
    When all of your measurements follow the same rules, you automatically get a more consistent UI.

  <h2>Baseline Grid</h2>
  <p>
    The grid is based on a 4px square. This value controls the proportion, balance, and vertical alignment of every component. All elements &ndash; including icons &ndash; are aligned to this unit.

  <h2>Spacing</h2>
  <p>
    When you design a component, elements are spaced following the grid. The same principle applies when you stack multiple elements within and between a component.
