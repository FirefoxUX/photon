  <h2>Apostrophes and Quotation Marks</h2>
  <p>Use the typographic characters (also called smart quotes) for apostrophes and quotation marks.</p>
  <p>Note that in Firefox for desktop and Firefox for Android in en-US this rule is enforced programmatically so a developer's code will be backed out if a text string contains the straight apostrophe or quote.</p>

  <h2>Commas</h2>
  <p>In the product, use serial commas (also called Oxford commas).</p>

  <h2>Hyphens and Dashes</h2>
  <p>
    Use hyphens (-) to create a single idea out of two or more words. Don’t add a space before or after the hyphen.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use en dashes (–) for ranges, like numbers (e.g., 1–9) and dates. Don’t add a space before of after the en dash.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use em dashes (—) to set related — but separate — thoughts off from each other. Add a space on either side of the em dash.
  </p>

  <h2>Ellipses</h2>
  <p>
    Use with Button or Menu items when the action requires additional user input, usually  via a Dialog, an Alert or moving the operation to another window or part of the UI.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not use an ellipsis in a link to indicate that more information is available at the destination.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, do not use ellipses in body copy.
  </p>

  <h2>Exclamation Points</h2>
  <p>
    Use sparingly, when the text reflects genuine excitement, not as a way to create excitement. Exclamation points aren’t a substitute for creating excitement.
  </p>

  <h2>Periods and  Other Terminal Punctuation</h2>
  <p>
    Terminal punctuation signals the end of a text element. A period is the most common terminal punctuation. Use terminal punctuation at the end of a sentence in normal body copy. In general, do not use punctuation at the end of a headline, button label, checkbox or radio button label, tooltip, text link (unless the link ends a sentence), or navigation element.
