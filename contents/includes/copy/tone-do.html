     <p>Here the same page is rewritten to strike a tone that is neither alarming or silly.  It demonstrates respect for the userâ€™s understanding and time - with a clear headline that quickly surfaces an apology for the error and the impact of the error and a further description of the cause and possible solutions. The page also relies on illustration to signal to the user that this issue is not serious, but without directly telling the user what they should think or feel.</p>
